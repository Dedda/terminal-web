Files to use with this tool are very simple:

They start off with a list of links. Every link
takes up one line starting with the name of the
link followed by a space and the link address.
Since this link is determined as the rest of the
line after the last space, the link itself cannot
contain any spaces.

Everything after the first empty of blank line is
considered the contents of the page and is
displayed in the terminal as is.
